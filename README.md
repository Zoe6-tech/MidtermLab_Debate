##Conclusion
“The water doesn’t know your age.” – Dara Torres (Olympic swimmer)

Clearly, swimming is one of the best workouts you can get. Swimming makes working out accessible for people who can’t or isn’t interested in running, biking, or other forms of cardio. To be clear, though, you will feel the burn. If you swim for exercise and not just fun, you’ll get your heart rate going and get the same benefits as cardio and resistance training. You just won’t get all sweaty while you’re doing it! And you’ll probably be able to swim for a longer period of time than you could run.

For a great body all year round, swim regularly. Find a gym with a pool so that you can incorporate swimming into your workout routines regularly.
